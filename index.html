            Instructions:
        </h2>
        <h3>Part 1</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In script.js, create a constructor function named Television.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add properties to the constructor for power status (on/off) and current channel.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement methods using prototypes for turning the TV on and off, which updates the power status.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a method to change the channel, updating the relevant property.
            </li>
            <li>
                Include a method named getState that console.logs the TV's state in a readable format.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Part 2</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Instantiate at least three different Television objects with various states and channels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the getState method for each Television instance to display its state in the console.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>
            Part 3
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Test each method to confirm that the Television objects are working as expected.
            </li>
            <li>
                Verify that the getState method outputs the correct status and channel.
            </li>
        </ol>
